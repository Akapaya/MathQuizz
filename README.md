# Unity Project: Math Quizz

Welcome to my Unity repository, where I share my project developed as part of my gaming development.

## Project description

### Math Quizz
The game generates a random count and several numbers, the player's objective is to take the number that completes the count to the bottom right in the middle of the grid and click on the number, if it is right it passes the level, if it is wrong it is gameover.
